                    the first request is handled immediately after it arrives, and also the second request is handled
                    immediately after it arrives (and after the first request was processed).
                </li>
                <li>
                    I tested a few time intervals between the first and the seconds request in order to test situations
                    in which the second request arrives before, during and after the processing of the first one
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>

        <li>test a few handlers registered in the same time (more than one .use() calls)
            <ul>
                <li>the suitable handlers will be called by the order of the .use() calls</li>
                <li>if next() is not called in one handler, the next handlers won't be run</li>
            </ul>
        </li>

        <li>test app.close()
            <ul>
                <li>close the server and then resart it</li>
                <li>make sure it was restarted successfully</li>
            </ul>
        </li>

        <li>use an handler that throws Error and verify the server doesn't crush
            <ul>
                <li>the handler is registered using .use()</li>
                <li>when the suitable url request is received the bad handler is called and throws Error</li>
                <li>the server doesn't crush and continues to work well in the next tests</li>
            </ul>
        </li>

        <li>destroy the socket immediately after the request is sent
            <ul>
                <li>the server will handle the error correctly: it won't crush and won't leak fds</li>
            </ul>
        </li>

        <li>end the socket immediately after the request is sent
            <ul>
                <li>the server will handle the error correctly: it won't crush and won't leak fds</li>
            </ul>
        </li>

        <li>use rootResource with and without / in the beginning
            <ul>
                <li>it works both ways</li>
            </ul>
        </li>

        <li>handle different files in the same time</li>

        <li>load (stress) tests - 150 connections from each of these categories
            <ul>
                <li>
                    the client uses keep-alive and doesn't close the sockets - server should close the connection after
                    timeout of 2 seconds
                </li>
                <li>
                    the client uses keep-alive but closes the socket after the response is done.
                </li>
                <li>
                    the client uses "Connection: close"  - the server should close the connection immediately
                </li>
                <li>for each of these 800 responses we verify every field, and also the response body</li>
            </ul>
        </li>

        <li>request an empty file - the response is 200 OK without a body</li>

        <li>test memory and fd leaks
            <ul>
                run 400,000 requests and after it finishes check that the memory used didn't increase and that there 
                are no open file descriptors (with handle.exe)
            </ul>
            <ul>
                It was also tested after stress with ab and after run of the tester
            </ul>
        </li>

    </ul>
    
    <h2>other tests</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>verify that the list example works well with the server on chrome, firefox and IE</li>
        <li>check the cookies handling with chrome
            <ul>
                <li>check that the set-cookie header from the server is parsed correctly by chrome</li>
                <li>check that the server parses the cookies from the browser correctly</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>test with ab (apache bench) - 15,000 connections concurrently</li>
        <li>check profile.html with chrome, firefox and IE</li>
        <li>manual stress test with multiple clients in different agents (localhost and another PC) at the same time</li>
        <li>test with cURL</li>
        <li>test every Content-Type with a browser</li>
