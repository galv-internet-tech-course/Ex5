general comments about the course
---------------------------------
I took this course because I think that web technologies have great importance in the software industry,
and I felt that I must learn this area.
I have experience in other fields of software development, but for some reason I didn't deal with web technologies
until today, and I saw this course as a chance to learn the basic topics in this area.
Now I feel that I understand the basic concepts of web development, and it is much easier for me to learn other topics
that were not covered in the course. I am sure that in the future I will come across these technologies many times
in my work.

Most of the work in this course was at the end of the semester. I think that it would be smarter to start with the
main exercises (ex3, ex4 and ex5) earlier in the semester.
In addition, there was a strong focus on NodeJS. Perhaps if the node exercises were shorter, it would be possible to
learn other subjects that weren't covered in the course.

Overall, I think that the course was great.
